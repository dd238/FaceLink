Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):
The instructions were easy to follow because this is what we are studying but always assume the user is stupid and make sure your instrucitons are super simplified. The GitHub page and ReadMe was super nice and everything was well documented. The web page looked super nice. Great job!ÃŸ
