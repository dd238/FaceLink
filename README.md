# FaceLink

## Description
Employers often trawl applicantsâ€™ social media presences for objectionable behavior. We are creating a business facing application that streamlines the process, combining API data from LinkedIn with that of Twitter and cross referencing them. The final product will have a web-based UI that displays the search results using python to make the API calls and process the data.

## Todo's

### Samy
* ~~write abstract~~
* ~~Twitter search API call function - takes in user name, returns list of twitter-user objects, Twitter API function that returns (objectionable) tweets as list of strings for a given user~~
* ~~web back end to update linkedin profile preview and objectionable tweets~~

### Dylan
* ~~Linkedin user API call function - takes in user ID, returns Linkedin user object w/ data (e.g. work history, education, etc.)~~
* ~~finalize linkedin user class (help christina use the api function for her todo)~~
* ~~make poster~~

### Paul
* ~~find objectionable tweets function~~
* ~~Web front end (just a skeleton: text box, section for linkedin profile preview, and a section for tweets)~~
* ~~web back end to update linkedin profile preview and objectionable tweets~~

### Christina
* ~~Linkedin user class~~
* ~~finalize linkedin user class (add functionality so the object class can return work history, education, etc.)~~
* ~~make poster~~

### Later
* linkedin scraper (w/ selenium or beautifulsoup)?
* function to compare users? twitter user data is sparse though, and linkedin doesn't give us any extra attributes
