Code Reviewer: Sierra Clinourne

On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of 6 based on the following criteria:

1  I was not able to compile the program due to insufficient information in the README.md file.

2  At least one of the programs has syntax errors and does not compile

3  The programs compile successfully but at least one generates runtime errors

4  The programs compile and run but the project does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results.
Specifically:

5  The programs compile and produce technically correct results but does not perform according to the documentation or does not comply with Chapman Coding Standards.
Specifically:

6  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented, following the Chapman Coding Standards.

Suggestions for improving the code (for extra credit!):

The tweets on the right seem to not be in chronological order. I dont know if that's something to do with the API itself or the SocialLink code, but I believe the project would be improved by the tweets being chronological. 

Another thing, in the README under the "Running" section part 2, the http://127.0.0.1:8000 has an extra t in it, so you might want to fix that.

Other than that, this is a really neat project.
